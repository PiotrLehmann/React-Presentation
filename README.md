# React-Presentation
Project for "www and script languages" subject. Purpose of this project is to present React to complete beginners.
Instead of doing it like a presentation I created a responsive website written fully in React,
which presents core concepts of this framework in each section

Move by clicking each section on the Navbar. Some items are clickable, try it.
